Java is an OOP language
What is oop? (object oriented programming)
    a programming ideology in which we reference "objects" to reference real world objects

4 pillars of oop?
    -inheritance
        -can take state and behavior from another class, called the parent class.(example: DNA, passed down from parent
         to child)
            -how do we achieve this in java?
                *We use the extends keyword on a class. (note: we can only extend one class. child extends to parent)

    -abstraction
        -the idea of hiding how something is done. (example: not knowing how a car works but knowing that if you
         push the gas pedal, it'll go)
         -where do we see abstraction in java?
            *in interfaces and abstract classes
    -encapsulation
        -restriction of direct access. (example: vending machines - you're not grabbing the Snickers bar,
         the machine does it for you.)
         -where do you see this in java?
            *with the use of access modifiers
                -public, private, default, protected
    -polymorphism
        -the idea of taking on many forms (example: water - takes on the form of any container it's in, can act
         differently depending on the temp and shape)
        -where do you see this in java?
            - overriding: method with the same method signature as a method in the same class
            - overloading: method with the same name in the same class but with different parameters (constructors)
